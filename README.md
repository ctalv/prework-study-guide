## Description

This project was meant to be a starter project. Currently, it will serve as a sandbox to try out different code during the bootcamp course. I plan to develop it into a more function and interactive website as I learn throughout the course.

To see JavaScript running, right click anywhere on the webpage, select "inspect", and navigate to the "Console" tab in the developer menu. There, it will list the topics we have learned and randomly select a topic from that list to study.
